7.x-1.x -> 7.x-2.x
--------------------------------------
- BEFORE UPDATING MODULE, DOWNLOAD NEW DEPENDENCY AND INSTALL: 
  http://drupal.org/project/usergroups_api
- Unpack the new version
- Run update.php (tables will be added, dropped, and updated)
- All of your checklists should be updated with each checklist
  having a single instance that should be completed.

This version introduces the idea of a checklist instance. An instance
is a version of the checklist that must completed. You can think of
it like this:
- You create a checklist (this is like a template).
- You add items to that checklist.
- You then create an instance of that checklist and assign who should
  complete the checklist. If no instances are created, no checklists
  will be required to completed. Also, if you assign different instances
  of a checklist to a user to complete, they will have to complete
  each instance on it's own (this means that a user could complete the
  same checklist multiple times if there are multiple instances of it).

Also introduced is the idea of a group/team instance. When creating an
instance, it can be defined such that the entire checklist is completed 
by a team together, meaning that if one user completes or checks an 
item off then it is checked off for everyone that must complete that 
instance.

Finally, the Usergroups API dependency will allow for more detailed
groups that must complete checklist instances, not just roles. For
example, you will be able to assign an instance to a specific user, or
other group as defined by your currently installed modules. See the
Usergroups API module for details on how groups are defined.
