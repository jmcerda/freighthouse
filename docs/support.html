          <center><h2>Security Assessment</h2></center>
          <p>Over the past year, we’ve seen an increasing number of web-wide security events. Attackers are increasingly seizing on security announcements for common pieces of internet infrastructure and launching immediate widespread exploit attempts.</p>
          <p>This is troubling, because it means that the window of time for internet-connected systems to apply their updates is shrinking. We already know that automated hack-attacks are running constantly to try and compromise outdated systems, but what’s new is the speed with which newly discovered vulnerabilities are being “weaponized”.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left">Such attacks thrive in an environment where security updates are handled piecemeal by a wide array of entities. Derelict web-servers that were launched years ago and are now neglected. Systems who have a sole administrator who is overburdened, or wants to take a vacation. One-off rogue projects that aren’t on anybody’s radar.</p><br />

            </div>
          </div><br />
          <p>At Freighthouse we’re working to create an outpost of sanity and security in an increasingly hostile internet. In addition to providing defense in depth by hardening our infrastructure and tightly controlling live customer environments, our unique website platform architecture allows us to provide rapid-response security at all layers of the stack in a way that is truly scalable.</p>
          <p>For the more than eighty thousand sites enjoying Pantheon’s protection, here’s a look at what we’ve handled in just the past few months:</p>
          <p><strong>Drupalgeddon</strong></p>
          <p>Pantheon’s value has never been clearer than with the recent critical core security issue with the Drupal CMS. In addition to sounding the alarm and helping our customers easily apply the patch with a single-click, we created a proactive filter designed to block attempted exploits against unpatched sites.</p>
          <p>Within a matter of hours <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/what-we-are-seeing-drupal-sa-2014-005">our Web Application Firewall began logging and blocking attempted exploits</a>, eventually numbering in the tens of thousands. Our ability to log and analyze the attempted attacks was instrumental in helping the wider community understand the symptoms of an exploit — how to identify and recover.</p>
          <p><strong>Shellshock</strong></p>
          <p>In late September, a series of vulnerabilities were announced affecting the Bash shell, a core utility present on most Linux systems. This was one of the most widely weaponized exploits of 2014 since over half the servers on the internet were potential targets. Within the week, security services with a wide scope (like CloudFlare) were tracking <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-30/shellshock-draws-hacker-attacks-sparks-race-to-patch-bug">millions of attacks or a day</a>.</p>
          <p>Pantheon’s Systems Reliability Engineering team patched the bugs before they even had a clever moniker.</p>
          <p><strong>Heartbleed</strong></p>
          <p>Heartbleed was the first headline-making security fire-drill of the year. It exposed core flaws in the way standard encryption libraries work, jeopardizing sites that were intended to be secured behind HTTPS protection. Our CTO David Strauss called it, <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/heartbleed-fix">“a perfect storm for internet security.”</a></p>
          <p>In addition to being a high-risk vulnerability, for many systems the fixes required service or system restarts, making the fix a disruptive one. Our solution allowed us to protect all our sites within a matter of hours with zero reboots required.</p>

        <p>HOW IT WORKS</p>
        <p>1. Schedule your Launch Strategy session. You’ll learn how to keep your site up and running. We’ll demo how to use version control on Pantheon, how to deploy your site, from dev, test &amp; live, and discuss how Freighthouse scales sites in production. You’ll also learn the most common reasons people open support tickets—and how you can avoid roadblocks by setting up caching, switching between environments, load testing, and resource optimization.</p>
        <p>2. We may schedule a more detailed, technical call with your development team. </p>
        <p>3. Stay informed with brief, standup meetings. If we find a minor code issue, you hear about it before you launch. We may also set up separate training sessions for you and your development team.</p>
        <p>4. High-five your team on launch day. The Freighthouse support team is here when you need us. If you do need to open support tickets in the future, you’ll get a faster response, since we’re familiar with the particulars of your website and your business.</p>
